       "\n",
       "**1. Lockdown the empty‑luxury‑unit loophole**  \n",
       "   - **Hard penalty, not a suggestion**: A tax hike of 30–50% on vacant high‑end units that remain empty for > 12 months. That’s not a gentle nudge—it's a direct hit on the speculative profit margin.  \n",
       "   - **Exemption only for demonstrably affordable use**: A unit must be listed as either a social‑housing rental or a mixed‑income developer project to bypass the tax. Proof of a lease signed with an occupant under the median wage must be submitted quarterly.  \n",
       "   - **Enforcement**: A no‑exemption “audit trail” that the city council will use to track every empty block. If the audit finds a unit idle, the council imposes a mandatory “price‑control” certificate, which forces the owner to cap rent or deliver an affordable block.\n",
       "\n",
       "**2. Re‑zone the speculative hot‑spots**  \n",
       "   - **Speed‑up planning**: The council will fast‑track rezoning approvals for parcels that historically have attracted more-than‑median price appreciation (the “speculation buckets”).  \n",
       "   - **Mandatory mixed‑income ceiling**: 40% of the built‑up floor area must be allocated to units priced below the 30th‑percentile wage level, with the rest labeled as “community‑benefit”—that is, free of excessive price surges.  \n",
       "   - **Financial leverage**: The council can offer matching grants or infrastructure levies to developers who meet the mixed‑income threshold, but will deny any concessions to those who don’t.\n",
       "\n",
       "**3. Turn land from a commodity into a public asset**  \n",
       "   - **Public ownership of under‑utilised land**: Identify parcels that are held by speculators with no development plans (no one has filed any permit or plan in > 3 years). Transfer these to a “Brisbane Affordable Land Trust.”  \n",
       "   - **Lease‑to‑build model**: The Trust will lease the land to accredited developers who commit to a 20‑year affordable delivery plan. At the end of the term, the land reverts to the Trust and can be reused for community amenities or more housing.  \n",
       "   - **Incentivize developers**: Provide tax relief for the developer’s first 10 % of units that fall below the median household wage level.\n",
       "\n",
       "**4. Institutionalize a “speculative‑interest” levy**  \n",
       "   - For every property transaction that exceeds the 75th‑percentile value in a given suburb, impose a 1–2% levy. The revenue goes directly into a state‑funded affordable housing program.  \n",
       "   - The levy should be transparent and recalibrated annually, ensuring the policy stays responsive and discourages speculation long‑term.\n",
       "\n",
       "**5. Enforce data‑driven decisions**  \n",
       "   - **Real‐time market dashboards**: The council publishes a dashboard that tracks each block’s occupancy rate, price appreciation, and rent‑to‑income ratio.  \n",
       "   - **Zero‑tolerance for data manipulation**: Developers that submit false occupancy data face immediate fines of 5% of their sale price.  \n",
       "   - **Whistleblower support**: Create a secure hotline for residents reporting speculative sit‑nights or illegal land hoarding.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Bottom line: no more lip service.**  \n",
       "These measures have been tested elsewhere—cities that imposed mandatory empty‑unit taxes and fast‑tracked mixed‑income rezoning saw a 10–15% reduction in speculative buying and an increase in truly affordable units. Brisbane can replicate that. The question isn’t *if* the council will act, but *when* they stop giving speculators a free pass and start treating our streets as a public good rather than a private playground.\n",

If the council doesn’t take these actions, they'll keep ceding Brisbane to a handful of high‑net‑worth individuals and letting ordinary families drown in the high‑price tide.
